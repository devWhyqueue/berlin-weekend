---

## Tasks

### 1. Research & Collect

* Use **recent sources (≤ 24 months)** — local blogs, magazines (*Mit Vergnügen*, *Tip Berlin*, *Exberliner*, *iHeartBerlin*, *High Snobiety*, *Time Out Berlin*), Reddit threads, etc.
* Collect bars that stand out for:

  * **Ambience** (cozy, cocktail, dive, craft beer, speakeasy, etc.)
  * **Quality** of drinks or uniqueness (signature cocktails, local brews)
  * **Indoor seating focus** (good for colder weather; not terrace-only)
* For each bar, record:

  * Name
  * Address + district/Kiez
  * Type (cocktail / speakeasy / pub / wine / beer / chill)
  * Price level (€, €€, €€€)
  * Highlights (1–2 bullets)
  * Opening hours (for a typical weekend night)
  * Official/social link
  * Source URL(s)

---

### 2. Vet & Filter

* Confirm the bar is **active**, **indoor-friendly**, and open evenings.
* Remove duplicates or purely terrace-based places.
* Keep a **varied mix** (avoid 5 cocktail bars in one district).
* Prefer bars with consistent positive reputation (Google Maps, blogs, IG).

---

### 3. Select & Route

* Choose up to **5 bars** that can reasonably be visited by **bike or BVG (U-/S-Bahn, tram, bus)**.
* Ensure **each transfer ≤ 20 minutes** and the total route is geographically coherent (no cross-city jumps).
* Sequence them logically for a realistic evening progression (e.g., start casual → end lively).

---

### 4. Output Structure

1. **Quick Summary**

   * Districts covered, number of bars, total travel time, best start time (e.g., 19:30–20:00).

2. **Itinerary (in order)**
   For each stop:

   * **Stop N: Bar Name** — short type / vibe / price
   * Address (+ Kiez)
   * Opening hours (for the chosen day)
   * Highlights (1–2 bullets)
   * Transit to next ≈ <X min bike/BVG>
   * Sources (short citations)
   * Official/social link

3. **Route Overview**

   * Ordered list of bars with travel times.
   * **Google Maps share link** (bike / BVG route).
   * Mention BVG lines (if applicable).
   * 1–2 backup bars nearby (in case one is full).

4. **Sources Summary**

   * Top 3–5 websites/blogs consulted + publication year.
